# WyzeFirmware


The firmware is in order of the creation with the 4.9.3006 file being the original file downloaded from Wyze
The working product is the Wyze_Backdoor.bin file which enables the telnet on the device with the other bin files having issues such as demo 1 crashing the camera when flashed onto the device to wyze_backoor.bin flashing onto the device but the telnet not working due to issues with the enabling of the busybox
